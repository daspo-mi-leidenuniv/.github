# DASPO Group @ Mathematical Institute of Leiden University

Welcome to the official GitHub page of the **DASPO Group** (Data Analysis and Survival for Personalised Oncology) at the Mathematical Institute of Leiden University.

We focus on data analysis and statistical methods in survival analysis applied to personalized oncology research.

📬 **Contact**: For inquiries or collaboration, please reach out to the group via [daspo@math.leidenuniv.nl](daspo@math.leidenuniv.nl)
